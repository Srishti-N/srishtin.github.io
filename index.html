            <p>Hello and welcome to my website. This is my attempt at making an attempt at applying for your cohort. Firstly, I have some things I wish to admit…I have fully built this website in a week. Now understandably that was not what you want to hear from a potential applicant but please hear me out. I was procrastinating on the situation, worried about the prospects about working from home, worried about leaving my job and generally knowing I may not produce my best work in such a small space of time. But after speaking to great friend, I came to conclusion that I should try. As we approach the application deadline, I think this week has possibly changed my life for the better. Yes I am aware my website is riddled with mistakes, and it’s a bit weird but I don’t remember ever feeling so challenged…I juggled my day job from home and coded in the evening and I honestly loved it. So I decided to use my website as a documentation of what genuine passion and hard work can achieve and how much I can learn from my mistakes. This is a website of trail and error which became learning. For example, the starting page was meant to be a navigation bar but I was so frustrated in trying to make it work that I incorporated as a design element instead, which is what I have decided will be the content of my carousel instead of terrible holiday pics circa 2017. My genuine fear before starting this process was the notion that coding is all about maths and pure logic, but in this process I have come to realization that because my logic is not the same as others, doesn’t mean I am wrong as long as the end result is the same, even if it takes me longer and I make mistakes along the way. The pictures I have included of myself are there so you can verify I am the same person if invited to interview and that one of my few best friends is a dog.</p>

    <p>So why am I applying? As I stated before, I feel I haven’t been challenged for a long time. Not only that but I feel with coding I would have access to world where you can change lives and make a difference big and small. Technology is integral to our lives, and I want to be a part of it and not just a consumer of it. I currently work in management consulting, for a firm that specalises in digital technology and within this role, I have learnt that to be a part of a changing world, you have understand the language that change is being written in. In my current role, I have also come to realization I would like to be a part of the small tech/start-up companies and eventually learn skills to be leader and help young people. I believe what I would learn at Founders and Coders would give the confidence for my future work but also others will entrust in me that I have the skills and knowledge from my coding background to support my decisions. I believe in tech for better, and I believe in working with people who are just as passionate as I am. </p>
